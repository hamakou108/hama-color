# HamaColor

## Description
HamaColor is a browser extension that changes the color of the screen edges based on user-defined URL patterns. This helps users visually distinguish browser tabs or environments (e.g., development, staging, production) quickly.

## Features
- Customize screen edge color based on URL patterns.
- Define multiple rules for different websites.
- Simple and intuitive rule format (pattern,color).
- Lightweight and unobtrusive.

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Recommended)
*(TODO: Add link here if/when published)*
1. Go to the HamaColor page on the Chrome Web Store.
2. Click "Add to Chrome".

### Manual Installation (for developers or testing)
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/hamakou108/hama-color.git`
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5. Select the `dist` directory within the cloned repository. (Note: you might need to run `yarn build` first to generate the `dist` directory).

## Usage
Rules are defined as a list of comma-separated pairs of URL patterns and colors. Each rule should be on a new line.

1. Click on the HamaColor extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. The popup will show a textarea for your rules.
3. Enter your rules in the following format:
   ```
   <URL_pattern>,<color>
   ```
   - `<URL_pattern>`: A string that will be matched against the current tab's URL. This can be a full URL or a partial match (e.g., a domain name or a specific path).
   - `<color>`: Any valid CSS color name (e.g., `red`, `blue`, `green`) or hex code (e.g., `#FF0000`, `#00FF00`).

   **Example:**
   ```
   github.com,red
   developer.mozilla.org,#0000FF
   localhost:3000,rgba(0,255,0,0.5)
   ```
4. Click "Save". The extension will apply the color to the edges of the screen for any tab whose URL matches one of the defined patterns. The first matching pattern will be used.
